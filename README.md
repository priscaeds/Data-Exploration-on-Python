# Project Overview
This project involves writing codes to perform data analysis of a product dataset.

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Microsoft Excel and  contains information about various products, including their prices, locations, revenues generated etc.

## Project Structure
This project is structured into the following:

1. DATA IMPORT: importing the product dataset into a Python environment.

2. DATA ANALYSIS: performing correlation analysis, sorting and filtering, descriptive statistics and others.

3. DATA VISUALIZATION: creating a dashboard to visualize the data and communicate insights and trends.

4. PREDICTIVE MODELING: building logistic and lineasr moels to make predictions on the dataset.


## Tools Used
The project require the following libraries and tools:

. Python

. Pandas

. NumPy

.Matplotlib

. Seaborn

. Scikit-learn

## Insights Gained
The analysis revealed correlation between different product features such as product and profit, country and revenues generated and so on.

The analysis informs inventory management decisions and product optimization strategies such as product assortment, prices adjustment, stocking levels etc.

The logistic and linear regression models identifies the most important features that affects product sales.
